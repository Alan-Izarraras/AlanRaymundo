			<p>Here's a thought experiemnt:</p>
			<div class="justified-text-2">
			<p>Assume for a moment that randomness does not exist. There is no randomness at all, only probability. What does that tell you about the universe? What can you infer from this basic assumption? What disturbs you from this experiment ?</p>
			<p>Don't even go cosmic with this one, imagine every outcome of human society was deliberately built like that, by design. Cost of living always going up? by design. Soul crushing jobs to justify living? by design. Higher depression rates? by design.Fertility plummeting? by design.</p>
			<p>Under these circumstances, the only way to escape the current design is to implement a new one. This means out-willing the will of those who currently make the rules.</p>
