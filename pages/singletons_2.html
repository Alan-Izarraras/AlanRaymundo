			<p>Thought experiments are op. You just sit down and figure things out without operating in the real world. But that is a failed paradigm, isn't it? When you think experimentally, you are effectively computing in the dimension of mind. Normies often call this activity manifesting.</p>

			<p>Funny how population genetic models that are backwards in time (the coalescent) cannot deal with selection, and selection can only be simulated going forwards in time (e.g. literally observing what happens to selected alleles in a genomic construct). Much like entropy, selection in untraceable. Again, this follows the observation that statistics is easy but complexity (although deterministic) is simply untraceable. Coalescent patterns is a relatively simple random process while selection is highly deterministic but untraceable. https://x.com/TeoriaNeutral/status/1822676317172887595</p>

			<p>I think most "natural law" is born approximate, and rarely anything is fixed. The most probable explanation of why critical measurements appear to be fixed is because these things have been naturally conditioned into place across unimaginable time.
