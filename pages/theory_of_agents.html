			<p>Here's my theory of experience and agents (succinct version)</p>
			<p>The ingredients are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Experience</li>
				<li>Agents</li>
				<li>Objects</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Prerequisites: Reality is made of experience (there is "information" to be interpreted) and a first agent able to observe this experience. Experience and agent are likely the same thing (like some RNA type thing, which has the dual property of being software and hardware simultaneously).</p>
			<p>In the first step, there is experience and there is an agent that gets to have an experience. This agent has a special move called observation. When an agent observes, it is essentially differentiating a slice of experience, which results in new objects. Objects are themselves agents (they get to experience) but are simultaneously something new to be experienced. This new agent (any agent) also has the special move observe and so is also capable of creating new objects/experiences.</p>
			<p>You can picture how this becomes a cascade of infinite agents and experiences. The information content of the system is greatly reduced in each observation. An agent can infinitely observe and so is infinitely generating agents and experiences, effectively creating  embeddings of distinct realities</p>
			<p>This goes on and on until humans! The end.</p>
